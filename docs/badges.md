We have designed Badges to reward the most ambitious players with a satisfying award.
Progress and unlocked badges can be viewed in the Badges menu.
The total amount of badge levels is displayed below player's name, along with a star icon, for example: `17 ‚≠ê`

## ‚ûï How to add new badges?

You can easily add new badges by editing the Badges config file:

`unlimited_adventures/Badges/badges.yml`:

```
your_badge:
    '1':
        requirement: statistic_mine_block:STONE
        value: 100
    '2':
        requirement: statistic_mine_block:STONE
        value: 500

        value: 100
    '4':
        requirement: statistic_mine_block:SAND
        value: 150
```

Add rewards in the rewards config - `unlimited_adventures/Badges/rewards.yml`:

```
