# ⚙️ Having Performance Issues?
Experiencing lag or slow commands like `/rtp`? Don’t worry — we’ve got some quick tips to help! 💡

- **🌀 `/rtp` is slow?**\
This usually means your world isn’t pregenerated. Pre-genning your world can speed it up significantly!\
⚡ You can easily pre-generate your world using `/dashboard`

- **🛑 “Can’t keep up!” warning?**\
This is *normal* when the server is starting or reloading.
But if it happens regularly during normal gameplay — you might have a real performance issue. 🧠🔍

- **🔄 Constant issues while playing?**\
If you're seeing stutters, lag, or other odd behavior during regular play, it could be a sign of a deeper performance problem.

### 🛠️ Diagnosing the Problem
#### ✅ Check your server hardware:
- 🔍 **Look up your CPU model on Google**
- - If the single-core speed is **under 4.0GHz** or the CPU is **over 5 years old**, it might not be up to the task.
- - If your server is running on an **old, Intel Xeon CPU**, it might have issues.
- - Usually a good hosting uses a **Ryzen 9** CPU, and will give you 2-4 guaranteed dedicated cores.
- 💾 Make sure you’ve assigned at least **8GB RAM** to your server.

#### ➡️ Recommended hardware:
- 🧠 A **modern CPU** (preferably less than 5 years old) with strong single-core performance — **4.0 GHz or higher**.
- 💾 At least **8 GB of RAM**.
- 🖥️ **Dedicated hosting** is highly recommended — avoid shared hosting for stable performance and fewer surprises.
