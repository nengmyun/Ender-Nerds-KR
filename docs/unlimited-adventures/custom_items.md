> You can edit the parameters of custom items by going to:
```unlimited_adventures/CustomItems/items.yml```

#### How to change recipes?

#### How to unlock a recipe?
> If you have it enabled in the config, players will be required to unlock a recipe first, before they can forge an item.\
> In that case, you can unlock items for the players by executing `/forgeunlock [player name] [item name]`, for example: `/forgeunlock Steve1337 adventure_backpack`
