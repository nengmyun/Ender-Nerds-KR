### How to change the textures back to text? (prefix)

> To remove the rank texture, you need to execute:\
`/lp editor`\
> Then enter the link and locate a rank whose texture you'd like to remove. I've chosen the default (player) rank.\
> Find the 'prefix.0.&f'\
> Replace '' with your own text.\
> So, in my case that will be: 'prefix.0.&fPlayer'

### How to edit the rank texture?

In order to edit the rank texture, you need to go into the server's resource pack.\
```assets/minecraft/textures/custom/icons```\
This directory contains various server icons, let's say that you'd like to edit the texture of the ultra rank, in that case, you just need to edit the `ultra_icon` file.\
If you have edited the file, just save it and it should be working.
