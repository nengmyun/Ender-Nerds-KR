#### Is the setup Bedrock compatible?
> Yes! Unlimited Adventures can be joined on all devices! Crossplay Feature is included in the base package - you don't have to buy an addon! ❤️
> Use port `25567` to join our Bedrock test server!

#### I have a visual problem with Bedrock
> Please try resetting your cached resource packs.
> Main Menu -> Storage -> Cached Data -> Delete all Unlimited Adventures, Model Engine and Geyser packs


#### 🌲 Trees look weird!
> Our tree leaves have a custom, bushy texture, that makes the foliage beautiful.\

⚙️ *If you prefer, this feature can be easily removed from the resource pack.*

#### 🔧 Does this setup require additional configuration?

> Just start the server and it's ready for the play!

## :wrench: Technical

#### 🔧 Can I configure / translate the setup?
> Unlimited Adventures is designed in a way that allows almost every feature to be configured!\
