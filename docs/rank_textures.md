### How to change the textures back to text? (prefix)

> To remove the rank texture, you need to execute:\
`/lp editor`\
> Then enter the link and locate a rank whose texture you'd like to remove. I've chosen the default (player) rank.\
> Find the 'prefix.0.&f'\
> Replace '' with your own text.\
> So, in my case that will be: 'prefix.0.&fPlayer'

### How to edit the rank texture?

In order to edit the rank texture, you need to go into the server's resource pack.: 📁`assets/minecraft/textures/custom/icons`\
This directory contains various server icons, let's say that you'd like to edit the texture of the ultra rank, in that case, you just need to edit the `ultra_icon` file.\
If you have edited the file, just save it and it should be working.


:::tip
If you don't want to or don't know how to edit the rank textures, you can order the Rank Textures Package.\
It's 5x new rank prefixes for $8.90. Contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wdBFC7Hc6X) to order it.

### How to make Player rank prefix visible on TAB?

Go to 📁`plugins/TAB/groups.yml` and change this:

```
Default:
  tabprefix: "&7"
  tagprefix: "&7"
```
To this:
```
Default:
    tabprefix: "&f "
    tagprefix: "&f "
```
