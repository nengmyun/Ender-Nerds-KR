# :compass: Quests

Quests in our setup are handled by the powerful **BetonQuest** plugin.

All quests are contained in the üìÅ`plugins/betonquest/quests`

:white_small_square:`objectives.yml` file contains the objectives of the quests,\
:white_small_square:`events.yml` contains events that we're using to handle quests, like giving the objectives, rewards, finishing the quests, etc.\
:white_small_square:`items.yml` contains items that are used by quests, both rewards and objective items.



#### How to do X in BetonQuest?

I'm not really able to teach you how to use BetonQuest here, since it's a really complex plugin.\
However, if you want to learn it yourself, please visit [BetonQuest's Wiki](https://docs.betonquest.org/1.12/Learn-Beton/Welcome/).\
BetonQuest has it's own, dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/betonquest-organisation-407221862980911105) at which you will be able to get more help if you're stuck on a problem.
