# 👑 **Adventure Apparel**

Adventure Apparel is an **exclusive**, **custom-coded** system that allows your players to wear visible, fully 3D backpacks and tools on their body!

#### How to edit Adventure Apparel config?
> You can edit the parameters of Adventure Apparel system by going to:
```unlimited_adventures/AdventureApparel/config.yml```

#### Players cannot teleport or use a command
Due to Spigot limitations, Adventure Apparel might sometimes block teleportation.
We have created a workaround, that should allow you to use teleportation commands as usual.

Please go to the Adventure Apparel's config.yml and locate 'teleport-commands:'. It's at the bottom of the file.\
Now add all commands that don't work on your server to this list.\
This should fix your issue, if it doesn't, please make a report on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wdBFC7Hc6X).
