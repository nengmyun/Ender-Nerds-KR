### ❓ Which parameters should get the most attention?

- 💻 **Server Hardware** - your server needs solid hardware to be able to handle your players.
- 📟 **Dedicated/Shared hosting** - whether you have exclusive or shared access to your server resources (CPU, RAM, disk).

### 💻 How to choose the hardware?

Most important specs of your server hardware are:
- 💻 **CPU** - the engine of your server (metaphorically, literally the engine is Bukkit, Paper, etc.). Faster CPU = more performance.
- 💾 **RAM** - used by your server to hold the currently used data about your server's worlds, players, mobs and plugin data. The more RAM you have, the more capacity your server has to operate.
- 💿 **Disk space** - allows you to store your world map along with all the fancy (and not fancy) builds your players have created!

### 📟 Dedicated or shared hosting?

Hostings come in variety of prices. One of the most important factors for the pricing is whether the hosting is shared or dedicated.\
If you are serious about creating a prosperous and quality server, you should lean towards a dedicated hosting.

#### Dedicated hosting
- 💡 Performance - offers dedicated resources which results in better performance, faster load times and ability to handle more players without lag.
- 💰 Cost - more expensive, suitable for more serious server owners.
- ⚙️ Flexibility - You can host a web page, discord bot and other things on your server, without having to purchase everything separately.

#### Shared hosting
- 💡 Performance - resources are shared among multiple users which can lead to slower performance during peak times or if another server is using a lot of resources.
- 💰 Cost - more affordable, making it a good choice for casual endeavours.
- ⚙️ Flexibility - you are only hosting your server which makes management simpler.
