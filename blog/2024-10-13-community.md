## ‚≠ê Benefits of creating a community

Gathering a community allows us to talk with people of the same interests, share the joy of playing together but also helps to stay motivated on the project!

### üì£ Why should you create a community, even before releasing your server?
- If your server is not released yet, a community of fans awaiting the release will motivate you to stay disciplined!
- Fans waiting (im)patiently on your Discord will hype you up! They might also come up with their own lore for your server, create fan arts and plan their endeavours with others.
- Communities tend to grow! Letting your players unite allows them to invite their friends and family and share the excitement together!
- Create 'Beta Tester' roles for the early adopters to make players more engaged and get more of that invaluable, early feedback!

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to create a community?

### üì± Discord
- It's commonly used to host communitites and for a good reason! Discord is great, everyone knows and uses it already, it's friendly and easy to utilize for purposes of your server!
- Create a clean Discord server and invite future players even before your server is released! Make sure to have something to show though, if you don't have great screenshots or even better - videos of your server, then perhaps hold on with announcing it!

### üì¢ Engage your community
- Regularly post sneak peaks and announcements for your players! That will hype them up!
- Host contests and lotteries! Let your players win fun rewards such as: Discord Nitro, Steam Gift Cards, Server Currency, Items or Ranks and even real life accessories, such as gaming keyboards!
- Create competitions for the players! Build competitions are well known, but you can also do screenshot competition and use the best one for server promotion later! PVP competition, dungeon clearing competition, paintball competition and more!
