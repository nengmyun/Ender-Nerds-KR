title: License System
---

## 🛡️ Why is there a license system?

I understand that some customers may have concerns about licensing, so here’s full transparency.

Just like 99% of software you use — even free tools or games — this setup uses a lightweight license system. It’s not about control. It’s about fairness and sustainability.

## 🔧 How does it work?

1. On our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/wdBFC7Hc6X), you simply click a button to generate your license key.
2. Paste the key into your server — and you're ready to go!

From that point on, our robust authorization system takes care of everything automatically.\
Changes like IP address or server hardware won’t interrupt your access.\
No manual reactivation needed — it just works.

## ✅ Here’s why it’s important:
- 💸 **Fair refunds**. Thanks to the license system, I can offer a full [30-day refund policy](/money-back-guarantee). Without it, people could simply buy, refund, and keep the setup — which isn’t fair to honest users.
- 🚫 **Protection from piracy**. When I’m protected from unauthorized use, I can afford to keep working on the setup long-term, improving it and supporting it.
- ⚡ **Faster support and updates**. Licensing helps me verify users quickly, deliver personalized support, and ensure updates go to those who should receive them.
- ⏱️ **Respect for my time**. I’ve spent thousands of hours developing and refining this product. Licensing ensures those who benefit from it are the ones who support it.

## 🔐 What data does it collect?
None. The license system checks your key and server identity to confirm it’s valid. That’s it — no tracking, no personal data, no hidden behavior.

## 🧩 What if you stop working on this setup?
Simple: if I ever stop supporting the project, the license check will be removed. You won’t lose access. You paid for it — you keep it.
